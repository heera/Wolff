Wolff is a ridiculously small and lightweight PHP framework which follows the MVC pattern while having useful functions and utilities like a template, route, loader, session and language system. 

It is intended for those who want to build light websites without having to do everything from scratch or using too large frameworks and libraries.

## Features

* **Fast**: Due to its small size and simplicity, you don’t have to worry about loading times or resource usage.

* **Simple**: It’s not only small, but simple as well; with a clean documentation and easy way to use.

* **Extensible**: Take advantage of the custom libraries you can make in Wolff and its language system to expand your page.

* **Clean**: The routes system allows you to have clean and friendly URLs, and the template system makes the php code cleaner while separating the logic from the view.

* **Dynamic**: You can work however you want without strictly following the Wolff design.
